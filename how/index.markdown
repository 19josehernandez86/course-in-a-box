This course is an experiment in leveraging GitHub to collaboratively take a course.

## Signing up
To sign up for this course you need to fork this repository and submit a pull request. We hope you've already done this. Making edits in your own version and submitting pull requests are the basic way that this course will work.

## Projects
Every module in this course will have projects to do. We want to do those projects here as part of this course...

## Talking with each other
We encourage deeper conversation around this course other than just working together. For that we will use [the P2PU community forum](http://community.p2pu.org).
