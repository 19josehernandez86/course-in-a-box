## What is good feedback?

Think back to a time when you received feedback, both good and bad. How did it feel? Did the feedback help you achieve your goal? Share your experiences on the [forum](http://community.p2pu.org/t/what-is-good-feedback/1292) and lets figure out what good feedback looks like from experience.

## Give feedback.

How about practicing giving some good feedback. Go to the ['New Course'](http://community.p2pu.org/c/new-courses) category and pick a course to give feedback on. Structure your feedback as follows: 

1. Say specifically what you like about the course.
1. Ask for clarification on things that you don't understand or don't agree with.
1. Make suggestions after hearing the answers to your clarification questions.

## Create badges for your course.

Badges are a good way to facilitate feedback on projects in a course. Design a badge for every project in your course. You can create a badge on [badges.p2pu.org](https://badges.p2pu.org). For in depth details on creating badges, you should see our [course on creating a badge](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/653/content/1254/) for your course.

Some good example badges to look at are: 

- [WikiSOO Burba Badge](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/22/)
- [Deeper Learning](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/323/)
- [I Walked with #WALKMYWORLD](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/347/).

To add your badges to your course, you should grab the embed code from the badges page by clicking on the embed button and paste the code into a seperate section in your module called badges.

This is an example of what the embed code looks like:

{% highlight html %}
<iframe id="badge_embed" type="text/html" frameborder="0" height="310" width="210" src="//badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/3/embedded/?rendering=normal"></iframe>
{% endhighlight %}
