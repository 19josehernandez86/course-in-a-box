# Projects

## Create badges for your course

What type of feedback do you wish to facilitate in your courses. Design a badge that can be awarded for student projects.

Design a badge for every project in your course. You can create a badge by registering on [badges.p2pu.org](https://badges.p2pu.org).

For in depth details on creating badges, you should see our [course on creating a badge](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/653/content/1254/) for your course.

To add your badges to your course, you should grab the embed code from the badges page by clicking on the embed button and paste the code into a seperate section in your module called badges.

This is an example of what the embed code looks like:

{% highlight html %}
<iframe id="badge_embed" type="text/html" frameborder="0" height="310" width="210" src="//badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/3/embedded/?rendering=normal"></iframe>
{% endhighlight %}
