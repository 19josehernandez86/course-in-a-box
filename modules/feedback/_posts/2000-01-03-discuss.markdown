## How others do it

[Why Open](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/), [Writing for Change](http://writing4change.p2pu.org) or [Play With Your Music](http://playwithyourmusic.org) are good examples to look at.

- How did people give feedback to each other on the work they did?
- Did the course use badges?

Have a look at the following badges: [WikiSOO Burba Badge](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/22/), [Deeper Learning](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/323/) or [I Walked with #WALKMYWORLD](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/347/).

- What courses were they part of?
- Did the course they were part of include other badges?
- Did learners give each other feedback on projects?


## Feedback in your course

What type of feedback do you wish to facilitate in your courses.

## Hangout

We will have a [hangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/course-in-a-box) to share our answers to the questions about and talk how we can apply it to our course.

If you can't join the hangout, don't worry, discussion will also take place on [discourse](http://community.p2pu.org/).
