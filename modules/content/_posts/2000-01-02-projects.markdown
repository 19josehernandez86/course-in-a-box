# Projects

## How will you find and develop content for each module?

In the previous module on learning you started to divide your course in modules and define projects for every module. Now it is time that you fill out the modules with the content. To create content within a module, you need to create a section in the module the same way you created the 'Projects' section for every module. Go to the folder for the module ex [https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/tree/gh-pages/modules/module-1/_posts](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/tree/gh-pages/modules/module-1/_posts) and create a new file for every section that you want within the module.

Remember that the file name needs to start with a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD-your-section-name.md. The date determines the order of the sections in every module.

- Find resources to add to each module. It can be videos, infographics, audio or something else.
- Reach out to experts in the area of your course for suggestions on content that you can use. You can also ask them to contribute or customize content for your course. A good place to reach out for experts could be your personal networks (facebook, linked in, the people you work with) or online communities (stack exchange, quora, twitter, other people taking this course).
- How will learners create content for other learners?

## What will the voice or vibe of your course be?
- Will your course have a playful vibe? A theme?
- Will you use a character or a mystery?
- How will people remember your course?
