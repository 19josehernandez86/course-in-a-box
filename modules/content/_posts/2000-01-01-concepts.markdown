# Developing Content

Traditionally, online courses followed this very top-down, regimented formula:

But open online courses think about content a bit differently. Since learners will find their own resources and interact with others, knowledge emerges organically. Here are a few ways that you can think about developing content in your course: 

### Peers co-create the content. 

In the video above, Jim Groom mentions that content is the "residue" of interactions in the course. What this means is that, when the activities are open-ended and creative, the social interactions around them build out much of what we think of as "content" for an open course. 

In another P2PU course, [Rhizomatic Learning](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/882/rhizomatic-learning-the-community-is-the-curriculum/), Dave Cormier asked learners to participate in the design of the course--the community was going to decide what to learn together. After Dave "officially" stopped running the course in week 6, the course continued to evolve without him--proof of success if there every was one. 

### Use openly-licensed content that already exists.

Creative Commons licenses and the Open Education movement have given rise to a wealth of open educational resources. If you'd like to pull together a few foundational resources, [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) and the [Saylor Foundation](http://www.saylor.org/) both are great sources for OER you can use in your course. Don't forget to attribute :)

### Learners can create tutorials for other learners.

Seasoned educators know that when a student teaches another student, their understanding deepens. That's peer learning in a nutshell. You might want to prompt learners to create a ["Teaching Kit"](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/t/activity-1-create-a-teaching-kit/332) to accompany their project. For our [Mozilla Webmaker course](https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/), learners created these tutorials to help someone else complete the project in the future. 

These teaching kits/tutorials ask learners to reflect on their project and model a ["reflective practice"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) (mmmmm, tasty self-assessment). At the same time, learners are creating their own OERs to contributione to the wider open learning landscape. 

## Course Length

Let's re-think "length." Because ideally what you are building is an online community--one that is ongoing, self-sustaining, and engaged. And in a community, you're never really "done." When is the last time you were done being a musician? Or a teacher? Or a writer? 

When you look at your community longitudinally, it's natural that folks are going to participate in different ways. Our fellow community-builder [Alex Hillman](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/) subscribes to the 80/20 rule: your community will break down into gradiations of someone active to most active participants:

Participation is a continuum of activity, and our data at P2PU bears that out. When looking at our recent P2PU course, folks reported engaging on a pleathora of ways:

So instead of thinking about beginning and finishing, you might think about the course you are developing as *an onramp to your ongoing community* that lives on P2PU or somewhere else. Maybe you run Arduino 101 every 8 weeks, but the Arduino G+ group is always there to help. That way the expert folks can help newbies. 

Some relevant data as your design your onborading: recent research by [Martin Weller](http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/design-responses-to-mooc-completion-rates.html) and [Katy Jorda](http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html) indicate that, no matter the discipline, there seems to be a 4-week long "sweet spot" in active participation.

So the first 30 days of your course make all the difference. We'd recommend a four-week onboarding course that runs regularly as an introduction to your learning community.
