>Computer Science textbooks aren’t always the most exciting learning materials in the world. But research shows that people learn better when they’re having a good experience. After some discussions, we decided that it would be good to create a character who would deliver the messages - a kind of steampunk International MOOC of Mystery. The irony was intentional - we wanted people to understand that a machine was talking to them, as if other MOOCs weren’t machines! It also allowed those who were writing the text to have a bit of fun, with an anchor for for presenting content that, if you’re not careful, can come across like different shades of eggshell paint.
