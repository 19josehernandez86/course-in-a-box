## How will this course work?

![Image of course workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/img/process.png)

During the next 4 weeks we will discuss the 4 different modules in this course - **community**, **learning**, **content** and **feedback**. Every week there will be some preparation, hands-on projects and a discussion for feedback and sharing to help you build your course!

## You promised me my own course! Where is it?

It's all in the box, promise! But you need to unpack it first :) Go on, take it out of [the box]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/start/the-box/)
