During this course we will learn the theoretical and technical parts by creating our own onlie course! To get started you should fork this repository on GitHub. You can do this by clicking the link below. You may need to log in or create a GitHub account.

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/p2pu/jekyll-course-experiment/fork" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i> Fork</a>

By doing this you have created your own copy of this course. This copy is where you will be working during the rest course. Some of the technical things may be challenging or frustrating, but by tackling it bit by bit and asking your peers for help, youâ€™ll soon be an expert and helping other people!

Now that you have a space to work, lets put a draft framework in place for your course.

**What will you call your course?** To update the title of your course, go to `https://github.com/<your-github-username>/jekyll-course-experiment/` and edit the file called `_data/course.yml`. You will see the title for this course there, change that to the name you decided on. Don't worry too much if you don't have the perfect name, you now know how to change the title for your course and you can update it at any time!

{% highlight yaml %}title: "Course Title"{% endhighlight %}

**Who are you building the cours for and what will they learn?** Will they be building something during the course. Put this basic information on the front page of the course to give a short overview of what to expect. To update the info on the front page, go to `index.markdown` and replace the text currently there to reflect what your course will be about. Once again, you can update it at any time and we will come back to this at a later stage.

So lets have a look at your course! you can view it by going to `https://yourgithubname.github.io/jekyll-course-experiment/`, just replace yourgithubname with your GitHub username.

## Resources and help

- See our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2000-01-02-github-cheatsheet %}">GitHub Cheatsheet</a> if you get stuck with any git related things. 
- Ask a question on the [P2PU community forum](http://community.p2pu.org).

You may have noticed that the `index.markdown` file contained a few funny caracters. This is called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an easy way of writing files for the web. For some tips on how to get the most out of Markdown, see [our Markdown cheetsheet]({{site.baseurl}}/references/markdown-cheatsheet/).
 

**Possible error: pages not displayed.** You can get an email after forking the repository with the following message: "The page build failed with the following error: Page build failed". To solve this issue, check you have [enabled the automatic page generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator) on your repository. Another possible cause would be a missing whitespace in your newly added content. Double check it and commit again to trigger page generation.
