## Community in other courses

Take a look at how other courses does it. [Why Open](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/), [Writing for Change](http://writing4change.p2pu.org) or [Play With Your Music](http://playwithyourmusic.org) are good examples to look at.

- What does community look like in those courses?
- How do they interact?
- How do they celebrate success?

## Hangout

We will have a [hangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/course-in-a-box) to share our answers to the questions about and talk how we can apply it to our course.

If you can't join the hangout, don't worry, discussion will also take place on [discourse](http://community.p2pu.org/).
