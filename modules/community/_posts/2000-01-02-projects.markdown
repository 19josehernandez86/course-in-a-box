Now that we've talked about community, it is time to apply this to the course that you are building.

## Find your 'first 10'

Building a course alone is a daunting task. Start a new topic on discourse under the [new courses](http://community.p2pu.org/c/new-courses) category to tell people about the course you are building. Invite people to share their thoughts on the topic in discourse. This is a good opportunity to grow your network and to get other people to work with.

## What will community look like for your course?

The course you are creating will form a community of its own. How will people join your community? What type of community will you build for your course? Will it be a community of interest, practice or inquiry? Will you add a personality/theme to your community? Will the community keep going after the course is done?
