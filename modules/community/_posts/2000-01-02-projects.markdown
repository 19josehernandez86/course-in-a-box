## Find your 'first 10'

Building a course alone is a daunting task. Start a new topic on discourse under the [new courses](http://community.p2pu.org/c/new-courses) category to tell people about the course you are building. Invite people to share their thoughts on the topic in discourse. This is a good opportunity to grow your network and to get other people to work with.

## Community in other courses

Take a look at how other courses does it. [Why Open](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/), [Writing for Change](http://writing4change.p2pu.org) or [Play With Your Music](http://playwithyourmusic.org) are good examples to look at.

- What does community look like in those courses?
- How do they interact?
- How do they celebrate success?
