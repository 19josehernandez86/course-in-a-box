Now that we've talked about community, it is time to apply this to the course that you are building.

## Find your 'first 10'

Building a course alone is a daunting task. Start a new topic on discourse under the [new courses](http://community.p2pu.org/c/new-courses) category to tell people what course you are building. Invite people who might be interested to share their thoughts on the topic in discourse.

## What will community look like for your course? (should we remove this?)

The course you are creating will form a community of its own. How will people join your community? What type of community will you build for your course? Will it be a community of interest, practice or inquiry? Will you add a personality/theme to your community? Will the community keep going after the course is done? What tools will you use to build your community? Can you think of advantages and drawbacks these tools may have?
