## Join another P2PU course and observe 
You can choose any P2PU course, but if you have no idea where to start, here's a short list:

- [Why Open](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/) 
- [Writing for Change](http://writing4change.p2pu.org)
- [Play With Your Music](http://playwithyourmusic.org)

Here are some things to think about while looking at the course:

- How are the courses structured
- What are the exercises like? What is the product, how do people share it?

Complete one of the exercise from the course.

## Hangout

We will have a [hangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/course-in-a-box) to share our answers to the questions about and talk how we can apply it to our course.

If you can't join the hangout, don't worry, discussion will also take place on [discourse](http://community.p2pu.org/).
