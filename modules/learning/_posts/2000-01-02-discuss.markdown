## Join another P2PU course and observe 
You can choose any P2PU course, but if you have no idea where to start, here's a short list:

- [Why Open](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/) 
- [Writing for Change](http://writing4change.p2pu.org)
- [Play With Your Music](http://playwithyourmusic.org)

Here are some things to think about while looking at the course:

- How are the courses structured
- What are the exercises like? What is the product, how do people share it?

Complete one of the exercise from the course.

## Hangout
