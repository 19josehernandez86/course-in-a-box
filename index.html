				<h2>What are your experiences?</h2>

				<p>Online courses often feel large, intimidating and anonymous. It's hard to feel invested
					in multiple choice quizzes, textbook chapters and hum-drum Q &amp; A forums where you
					don't know anyone.</p>

				<p>In a stellar learning experiece, you'd know who was in the room and feel super-comfy.
					You'd make projects together and find help when you get stuck. You'd want to send people
					thank-you cards and chicken soup.</p>

				<p>We know designing a creative, participatory community can be tricky. We're here to help
					you craft assignments that rule, build an audience and support you along the way. You'll
					even learn a few technical skills in the process. Don't worry, the 1s and 0s wash off
					pretty easily.</p>
