    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This is an experiment in mixing the creation of a course and the running of a course in a way that would be hard to distinguish using Github pages.</p>
    <p>Things you may learn include creating a course using Jekyll and GitHub pages, Markdown, theories of social learning and most importantly, some other great people!</p>
